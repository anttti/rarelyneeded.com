The definition of a _geek_ according to the dictionary in OS X:

> 1. an unfashionable or socially inept person.
> 2. a carnival performer who performs wild or disgusting acts.

Hi, I’m Antti and I’m a geek.

Most of the time I’m not performing wild or disgusting acts, and I tend to think of myself as not that socially inept. The definition above is sorely lacking. I find “geeking out” as being extremely passionate and truly interested in something. Being a geek is finding joy in things that might be totally invisible to “normal” people. I, for instance, enjoy taking care of my computing devices, carefully choosing the hardware and software I enjoy using. I spend surprisingly much time obsessing over text editors, color themes, fonts, line heights and what have you [1](p27837156294-1).

But it’s not all about computers. I also geek out on guitar stuff, board games, lately also coffee. I might not have the most expensive guitar gear that’s available, but usually I can rest assured I have the best for the money available. How can I be so sure? Extensive background research. I get great pleasure on browsing the web for reviews, user experiences and discussions.

If one does not deeply care about something, how can one experience pleasure?

I’m a geek and proud of it.
