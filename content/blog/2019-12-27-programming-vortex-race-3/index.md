1. Switch to a programmable (=non-default) layer by hitting `Fn`\+ `Right Shift`
2. Hit `Fn` + `Right Cmd` (or `Ctrl`)
3. A white LED switches on under the space bar, that means we're now in programming mode
4. Press the key to be re-mapped (a red LED starts flashing)
5. Hit the target key (or key sequence)
6. Commit by pressing the `Pn` key
7. Exit the programming mode by pressing `Fn` + `Right Cmd` (or `Ctrl`)

Let's have an example. In my ISO Nordic version of the Race 3 for some reason the `ยง` and `<` keys are mapped just the opposite as what's printed on the keycaps. Here's the exact keys I press to change them vice versa:

1. `Fn` + `Right Shift`
2. `Fn` + `Right Cmd`
3. `ยง`
4. `<`
5. `Pn`
6. `<`
7. `ยง`
8. `Pn`
9. `Fn` + `Right Cmd`

If I mess up and need to reset the current layer, I can do so by pressing and holding `Fn` + `R` for 5 seconds.
