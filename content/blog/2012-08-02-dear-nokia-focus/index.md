This subject is probably beaten to death already, but just a couple of the latest Nokia links:

[Nokia links up with Groupon to promote deals on phone maps](http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/08/02/us-nokia-groupon-idINBRE87103S20120802)

[Nokia Lumia 900 Gets Its Own Matching Pink Nail Polish](http://www.chipchick.com/2012/08/nokia-lumia-900-nail-polish.html)

Groupon crap and nail polish? Please.
