[How many people use Twitter’s own apps?]("http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/how-many-people-use-twitter-s-own-apps")

Speaking of Twitter clients, mr. Benjamin Mayo did some research on what clients people use. Not surprisingly most tweets come from the web interface and Twitter’s own native clients. Perhaps a bit surprising is to see Echofon as the biggest 3rd party client. It’s users are definitely quieter than the vocal minority using Tweetbot.

Also seeing Twitter for Mac on place 32 makes it clear why Twitter is not too interested in keeping it up to date.
