There are a lot of posts like this, but this one's mine. App defaults ála [https://defaults.rknight.me/](https://defaults.rknight.me/):

- 📨 Mail Client: [Fastmail's web UI](https://fastmail.com) on desktop, Mail.app on iOS
- 📮 Mail Server: [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com)
- 📝 Notes: [Bear](https://bear.app), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
  - Bear for personal things
  - I've been kicking the tires of Obsidian for work stuff, just to keep them separate from personal notes
- ✅ To-Do: [Due](https://www.dueapp.com), Reminders
  - I used to be big on GTD and OmniFocus, but at some point it just felt like it took more than it gave me, so I simplified
  - Due is great because it keeps on reminding me as I keep ignoring it
- 📷 iPhone Photo Shooting: iOS Camera
  - The power of defaults is strong here
- 🟦 Photo Management: Photos
- 📆 Calendar: [BusyCal](https://www.busymac.com/busycal/)
- 📁 Cloud File Storage: iCloud Drive
- 📖 RSS: [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com), [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com)
- 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: ...uhhh... the Phone app?
- 🌐 Browser: [Arc](https://arc.net), Safari, Firefox
  - Once you get used to Arc, it's really hard to switch away. I use Arc on my work laptop
  - Safari is still the go-to on iOS and it's also usually open on my work laptop too
  - Firefox is great on Windows!
- 💬 Chat: Slack, Telegram
- 🔖 Bookmarks: [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) but I use it so rarely it can hardly be mentioned
- 📑 Read It Later: Safari's Reading list
  - ...although more often than not, sending a message to myself in Telegram
- 📜 Word Processing: N/A
  - Funny to think about since using Word was so important during my university days, but I cannot remember the last time I really used a word processor to do word processing. It's plain text all the time all the way these days
- 📈 Spreadsheets: Google Sheets
- 📊 Presentations: N/A
  - Well actually it's the Google Whatever, but I use it so rarely it's not making the list
- 🛒 Shopping Lists: [Buy me a pie](https://buymeapie.com)
  - Actively looking for a replacement but I'm so picky it's hard! Really tempted to just build my own
- 🍴 Meal Planning: N/A
- 💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance: N/A
  - I guess I should grow up and start to do something here but 🤷‍♂️
- 📰 News: N/A
  - I do read a lot of news, but the app I use for that purpose is a web browser
- 🎵 Music: YouTube Music
  - Not particularly happy with this, but it plays music when I ask it to
- 🎤 Podcasts: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)
- 🔐 Password Management: [1Password](https://1password.com)
  - Been using for a loooong time but the user experience seems to be going downhill all the time. I guess I'm happy about the security side, but gosh darn it how hard can it be to make the autocomplete do anything at all when I rageclick it over and over again?!

## Bonus

- 🖥️ Terminal: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
  - iTerm 2 is just fine, I use Kitty only to feel special
- 🚀 Launcher: [Alfred](https://alfred.app)
  - Bought a lifetime license, so thanks to sunk cost fallacy, cannot even consider these newfangled raycasts and all
- 📘 Code editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - I tend to swing back and forth between VS Code and Neovim, but like in a dysfunctional relationship, always after a rough drunken night I find myself at the comforting lap of VS Code. I should seek therapy
- 🛢️ Database client: [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/)
  - It's only for Postgres, but are there any other databases even?
- 🎶 Music making: [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com)
