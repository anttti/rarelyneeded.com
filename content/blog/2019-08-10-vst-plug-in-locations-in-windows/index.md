Since I'm constantly confused with these, I'll just jot these down for me to reference later on.

- **C:\\Program Files\\VSTPlugins** \- 64-bit VST2 plug-ins.
- **C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\VST3** \- 64-bit VST3 plug-ins. (Live 10.1 and later).
- **C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VSTPlugins -** 32-bit plug-ins.

> **Note:** Live 10 is 64-bit only, so 32-bit plug-ins won't appear in Live 10. Likewise 64-bit plug-ins won't appear in 32-bit versions of Live.
