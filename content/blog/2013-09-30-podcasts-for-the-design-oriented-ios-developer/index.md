I listen to a lot of podcasts. And when I say a lot, I mean I subscribe to about 20 podcasts and try hard to listen to every episode of them. Most of the podcasts I listen to are about Apple, iOS/Mac/web development or design. Or in the optimal case, all of the above. I thought it’d be useful for likeminded people to take a peek at the Apple/iOS-related ones.

- [Developing Perspective]("http://developingperspective.com/"): Very insightful one-man show by [underscoredavidsmith]("http://david-smith.org/"). Always under 15 minutes!
- [Accidental Tech Podcast]("http://atp.fm"): Featuring my favorite internet hero [John Siracusa]("https://twitter.com/siracusa"). Never under 15 minutes!
- [Edge Cases]("http://edgecasesshow.com/"): Geek alert! [Andrew Pontius]("http://twitter.com/apontious") and [Wolf Rentzsch]("http://twitter.com/rentzsch") take a (very) deep dive into Apple tech.
- [Debug]("http://www.imore.com/debug"): A fairly new, conversational show about development. Hosted by [Guy English]("http://twitter.com/gte") and [Rene Ritchie]("http://twitter.com/reneritchie").
- [Core Intuition]("http://www.coreint.org/"): Extremely enjoyable weekly discussion between [Daniel Jalkut]("http://www.red-sweater.com/") and [Manton Reece]("http://www.manton.org/").
- [Identical Cousins]("http://identicalcousins.net/"): Kind of similar to Core Intuition, featuring [Brent Simmons]("http://inessential.com/") (Q-branch, NetNewsWire, Glassboard) and [Michael Simmons]("https://twitter.com/macguitar") (Flexibits, Hockeyapp). (Discontinued, but still worth a listen.)
- [The Talk Show With John Gruber]("http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/"): I guess if you’re even vaguely interested in the Apple world this is mandatory stuff. The show took a huge jump in quality when it switched from [5by5]("http://5by5.tv") to [Mule]("http://www.muleradio.net/"). I’m thinking it has to do with the fact that on Mule, [Gruber]("http://daringfireball.com") is the host (whereas on 5by5 [Dan Benjamin]("http://benjamin.org/dan/") used to host the show and Gruber just murmurred along).
- [Iterate]("http://bjango.com/articles/iterate/"): The only really design-oriented podcast of the bunch. I’ve tried some others too, but Iterate seems to be the best. Hosts: [Rene Ritchie]("http://twitter.com/reneritchie"), [Seth Clifford]("http://twitter.com/reneritchie") and [Marc Edwards]("http://twitter.com/marcedwards").

Curiously I used to listen to a whole lot of 5by5 podcasts. Now there are a total of zero of them on my list; a couple of interesting podcasts have ended ([Build & Analyze]("http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze") and [Hypercritical]("http://5by5.tv/hypercritical")), another one has moved network (The Talk Show).

By the way, Build & Analyze and Hypercritical have still episodes very much worth listening, in the (extremely unlikely) case you run out of podcasts to listen to.
