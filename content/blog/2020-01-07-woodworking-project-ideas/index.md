My scratchpad of ideas:

- Floor lamp to our livingroom
- A narrow shelf between the back of our bed and the wall
- A case for a keyboard
  - 304 x 95 mm PCB KBD67

  - Also, a carrying case?
  - 29,4 x 10,7 x 3-4 cm Idobo
  - Case vinyl cover is called ”Tolex”.
- Hanging lamp to our kitchen
- Watch storage box
- Pendants cut with a scroll saw
- Laptop stand
- Electrical & USB plugs mounted on a nightstand
- Plywood & plexi case for the Disney castle
- iPhone stand
- Support for wireless charging
  - A "cradle" of sorts that houses an Ikea charger at the bottom
  - Should automatically make sure the phone lays in a correct position to get charged
  - Could even be vertical?
