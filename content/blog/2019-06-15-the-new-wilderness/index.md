[Maciej Cegłowski](https://idlewords.com/about.htm) of the [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in) fame writes or speaks not too often, but when he does, it's always solid gold:

> No two companies have done more to drag private life into the algorithmic eye than Google and Facebook. Together, they operate the world’s most sophisticated dragnet surveillance operation, a duopoly that rakes in nearly two thirds of the money spent on online ads. You’ll find their tracking scripts on nearly every web page you visit. They can no more function without surveillance than Exxon Mobil could function without pumping oil from the ground.
> 
> So why have the gravediggers of online privacy suddenly grown so worried about the health of the patient?
> 
> Part of the answer is a defect in the language we use to talk about privacy. That language, especially as it is codified in law, is not adequate for the new reality of ubiquitous, mechanized surveillance.
