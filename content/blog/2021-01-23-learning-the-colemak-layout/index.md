...or, the Colemak DHm to be exact. After experimenting (and very much liking) the home row mods, the natural next step was looking into a more ergonomic layout than QWERTY. I landed on [Colemak DHm](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) due to it's suitability with ortholinear layout.

As expected, my WPM _tanked_. Slowly (suuuu-uuuper slowly) I'm picking up the pace with [Colemak Academy](https://www.colemak.academy/), but it's a long road ahead. Current WPM is around 15-20.
