I live and breathe in [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader). Sometimes (quite often) there arises a need to save a webpage for later, either because I don’t have the time to read it or I just want to save the page for referencing to later. Here’s how my process used to go with Google Reader:

- Find an interesting article
- Hit the star button to trigger [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com)
- IFTTT would then send the starred article to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) so I could catch up later
- Instapaper would post all articles sent to it to [Pinboard.in](http://pinboard.in) for more permanent storage.

Then when I consumed the saved pages:

- I’d hit Instapaper ~weekly and process at least part of the queued pages
- processing meaned “read and possibly move to a more persistent storage” such as local bookmark or re-add to Pinboard.in with appropriate tags

Then referencing to a previously saved article went like this:

- Start typing somewhat relevant words in Chrome’s Omnibox hoping to find the page from history
- If not found in history, googling it.

Why googling when the article is always pushed to Pinboard.in in the end? Because I find it far easier and way faster to just google the page, instead of opening a new tab and browsing to Pinboard.in, (possibly) logging in, and then attempting to search my bookmark library there.

So now I’ve found a better solution for these certain kind of higher quality / more important (yet not so important they’d live in browser bookmark bar) to me bookmarks. In fact, the solution has been staring me in the eye for quite a while now, but I’ve discarded it as “just another read it later -service”.

But no, I realized Kippt is just suited for scratching this kind of itch. For example, as my day job as a web programmer I run across many handy JavaScript libraries and articles. Many of these I think I could use at some future project, so I created a Kippt list for JS stuff. Now please note, this list is **not** for dumping every possible JS related blog post, but only for high quality content I most probably would otherwise end up googling. And sometimes it’s not that straightforward to find the thing in mind (it was a great jQuery lightbox…name just slips my mind…let me google for jQuery ligh-holy hell! THREE MILLION RESULTS!?).

So, [Kippt](http://kippt.com). For high quality web content. Also, it’s super pretty!

I’m [anttti](https://kippt.com/anttti/) on Kippt.
