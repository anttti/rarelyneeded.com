So during these last few days I've finally cracked how to use the arrow keys with modifiers on the 60% [Ducky One 2 Mini](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Mini-RGB) keyboard.

As the keyboard does not have dedicated arrow keys, arrows can be simulated by hitting Fn+IJKL. This brings up the question "how do I do Alt+arrows, Ctrl+arrows, Ctrl+Shift+arrows etc"? I found myself a bit confused as it seemed that sometimes I was able to do what I wanted, but not everytime. Here's the secret:

1. Press and hold the **modifier key(s)**, e.g. shift
2. Press and hold **Fn**
3. Press **IJKL**.

The "secret" being you need to hold the modifier **first**, then Fn, then arrows. If you want to do Ctrl+Shift+arrows, first hit Ctrl+Shift, then Fn, then arrows.

I have the 3rd DIP switch engaged on my keyboard, meaning the Caps Lock key acts as Fn (it's great, you should do that too. The internet has way too much shouting going on as it is anyway). When I did Shift+arrows the Caps Lock engaged anyway (just hitting Shift+Caps Lock even though Caps Lock was mapped as Fn enabled Caps Lock) and it was driving me nuts! Turns out this behaviour was apparently (and correctly) regarded as a bug by Ducky and it's fixed in [the latest firmware](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Mini-RGB) (scroll to the bottom of the page where it says "Downloads).
