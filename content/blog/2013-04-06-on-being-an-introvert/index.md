Chris Coyer of [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com) fame wrote an excellent piece about being an introvert to the Pastry Box Project. I’ve never thought about things that way, but after reading that I instantly got an “Aha!” -moment. I have no problem interacting with people, but I also very rarely find myself in crowded places, such as a bar. I just rather spend time at home with my wife and cats, fooling around with computers, guitars and whatnot. It’s nice to see I’m not alone (no pun intended).
