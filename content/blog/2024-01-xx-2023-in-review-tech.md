It brings me heaps of joy to see how 2023 seems to have kicked off a boon in the personal website sphere. I keep seeing so many Mastodon posts on my timeline with links to various more or less quirky blogs and poor old me keeps getting overwhelmed with the amount of new RSS feeds in [my feedreader of choice](https://feedbin.com). Such a great positive problem to have! I want to be a more active part of this indie web scene too. I’ve had blogs here and there for years on end, but it’s never been a priority for me. Not sure if it that will change all that much, but at least I’m trying to give it a shot starting…now. So, just like everyone else has been posting, here’s my 2023 recap.
