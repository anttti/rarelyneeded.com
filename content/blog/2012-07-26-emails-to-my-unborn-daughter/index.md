[“Emails to My Unborn Daughter”](http://www.staticmade.com/emails-to-my-unborn-daughter/)

Speaking of emails, this is such a great idea by Jeffrey Inscho:

> For the past five years, I’ve been writing emails to my son. Shortly after he was born in 2007, I created an email account in his name so I could write to him throughout his childhood and then turn the account over to him when he was of age.

Definitely something I’d consider doing if we had kids.
