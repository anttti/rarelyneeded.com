I visited Oulu with my [Futurice]("http://futurice.com") colleagues ([Riku]("http://twitter.com/RikuJ"), [Andre]("http://twitter.com/andrestaltz"), [Tuomas]("http://twitter.com/chlif") and [Ykä]("http://twitter.com/ykarikos") for an afterwork event filled with juicy web tech speeches. I talked about modern web app development, the JS frameworks and tooling and all that good stuff.

In case you’re curious, you can [download the slides]("http://rarelyneeded.com/talks/modern-frontend-development/modern-frontend-development.pdf") even though they might be a bit hard to follow without the actual talk.
