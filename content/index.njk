<h1>Hello, friend!</h1>
<p>My name is Antti, nice to meet you! I'm a web developer and an advocate for open web from Finland. In this <em>rarely needed</em> blog of mine I tend to write random notes about computers, programming, guitars and other ways of making noise mostly for myself, but I welcome you to browse through or even subscribe to the RSS feed!</p>
